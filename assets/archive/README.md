# Archive Folder

This folder contains legacy CSS files that were replaced by the unified framework system.

## Files

- `components.css` - Legacy component styles (replaced by `framework-unified.css`)
- `grid.css` - Legacy grid system (replaced by `framework-unified.css`)
- `style.css` - Legacy base styles (replaced by `framework-unified.css`)

## Status

These files are kept for reference only and are **not used** in the current codebase. All functionality has been consolidated into:

- `assets/css/framework-unified.css` - Main framework with all components, grid, and base styles
- `assets/css/typography-system.css` - Typography system

## Note

Do not reference these files in HTML or import them. They are maintained here for historical reference only.
