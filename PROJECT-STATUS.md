## Areas for Future Improvement

### Performance Optimization (Priority: Medium)

- ⚠️ CSS file size (~100KB unminified)
- ⚠️ Minification already available (`.min.css` files exist)
- ⚠️ Consider critical CSS extraction
- ⚠️ Font loading optimization

**Note:** Minified versions already exist, but could be integrated into build process.

### Testing (Priority: Low)

- ⚠️ Automated test suite exists (`tests/` directory)
- ⚠️ Manual testing recommended before major releases
- ⚠️ Browser compatibility testing

---

## Development Workflow

### Current Setup

- ✅ Git repository on `main` branch
- ✅ npm scripts for validation, testing, building
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks for quality checks
- ✅ Component sync system
- ✅ Version management

### Available Commands

```bash
# Validation
npm run validate:html      # Validate HTML
npm run validate:css       # Validate CSS
npm run validate:all      # Validate all
npm run lint:js            # Lint JavaScript
npm run lint:all           # Lint all

# Development
npm run server:start        # Start local server
npm run sync-components     # Sync component documentation
npm run check:consistency   # Check code consistency

# Testing
npm run test               # Run tests
npm run test:browser       # Run browser tests

# Version Management
npm run version:update      # Update version
npm run version:increment  # Increment version
