## Development Workflow Recommendations

### Setup
```bash
# 1. Initialize npm (if not already)
npm init -y

# 2. Install dev dependencies
npm install --save-dev cssnano postcss-cli terser htmlhint eslint stylelint

# 3. Create build scripts in package.json
```

### Build Scripts (Recommended)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:css": "postcss assets/css/*.css --use cssnano -d dist/css",
    "build:js": "terser assets/js/*.js -o dist/js/bundle.min.js",
    "build": "npm run build:css && npm run build:js",
    "lint:html": "htmlhint **/*.html",
    "lint:css": "stylelint assets/css/**/*.css",
    "lint:js": "eslint assets/js/**/*.js",
    "lint": "npm run lint:html && npm run lint:css && npm run lint:js"
  }
}
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Current branch: main
# All changes committed

# Recommended workflow:
git checkout -b feature/performance-optimization
# Make changes
git commit -m "feat: add build process and minification"
git checkout main
git merge feature/performance-optimization
```
